# COMP2850 Human-Computer Interaction Learning Outcomes Condensed

1. **Differentiate** between various people-centred design and evaluation methodologies, explaining their appropriate applications within software development processes. *(Understanding People)*

2. **Design and conduct** needs-finding activities including interviews, surveys, and observations to gather data about people's requirements and experiences. *(Understanding People)*

3. **Analyse** ethical implications of design decisions, including sustainability, privacy, and the role of artificial intelligence in human-computer interfaces. *(Ethical Design)*

4. **Evaluate** software interfaces for accessibility concerns across different disability categories and apply accessibility standards to address these concerns. *(Equitable Design)*

5. **Create** interface prototypes using appropriate fidelity levels and techniques (low-fidelity, rapid, throwaway) for different stages of the design process. *(Designing Interfaces)*

6. **Apply** iterative design processes that incorporate understanding of people, prototyping, evaluation, and refinement based on feedback. *(Designing Interfaces)*

7. **Analyse** how design constraints related to platforms, devices, and resources affect interface decisions and create solutions that balance usability, security, and privacy. *(Designing Interfaces)*

8. **Design and execute** appropriate evaluation methods to assess interfaces for utility, efficiency, learnability, satisfaction, and affective elements. *(Evaluating Interfaces)*

9. **Apply** universal and inclusive design principles to create software solutions that accommodate diverse human needs and capabilities. *(Equitable Design)*

10. **Critique** potential impacts of designs on society and communities regarding sustainability, inclusivity, safety, security, privacy, and potential harm. *(Integration with Software Engineering)*

11. **Collaborate** effectively in multidisciplinary teams to address complex HCI challenges, demonstrating skills in communication, negotiation, and shared decision-making during the design process. *(Group Work)*

12. **Demonstrate** professional dispositions including adaptability, meticulousness, empathy, team orientation, and inventiveness throughout the human-computer interaction design process. *(Professional Dispositions)*

13. **Integrate** people-centred design approaches with broader software engineering methodologies, showing how HCI considerations inform the entire development lifecycle. *(Integration with Software Engineering)*
