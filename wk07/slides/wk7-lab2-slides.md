paginate: true
---

# Week 7 • Lab 2
### Audit · Backlog · Inclusive fix

- Run structured accessibility audit
- Log findings with severity × inclusion risk
- Implement one high-impact fix
- Capture evidence for Task 1

---

## Learning outcomes
- Apply heuristics + WCAG 2.2 to your scaffold
- Populate inclusive backlog with evidence links
- Deliver one accessible fix end to end
- Package audit artefacts for assessment

---

## Why audit now?
- Inline edit + scaffold matured; time to validate
- Accreditation expects documented evidence
- Sets foundation for pilots + redesigns
- References:
  - `../../references/assistive-testing-checklist.md`
  - `../../references/example-accessible-inline-edit.md`
  - WCAG quick reference

---

## Audit plan
Create `week7/audit/plan.md`:
- Scope (paths, components)
- Assistive tech (keyboard, SR, JS-off)
- Criteria (WCAG A/AA, heuristics)
- Evidence capture plan (screenshots, transcripts)

---

## Heuristics walkthrough
- Nielsen + Shneiderman applied to your UI
- Map each heuristic to concrete component
- Document in `heuristics.md`
- Use findings to guide fix selection

---

## WCAG checklist
`week7/audit/wcag-checks.md`
- 1.3.1 Info/Relationships
- 2.1.1 Keyboard
- 2.4.3 Focus order
- 3.3.x Errors/Labels
- 4.1.3 Status messages
Record Pass/Fail, evidence link, notes.

---

## Backlog updates
`backlog/backlog.csv`
- Severity (High/Med/Low)
- Inclusion risk tags (Screen reader, Keyboard, etc.)
- Evidence column (link to notes/screens)
- Mark candidate fix for today (`true`)

---

## Fix one issue end-to-end
- Choose highest impact backlog item
- Implement change (templates/routes)
- Verify (keyboard, SR, JS-off)
- Gather evidence (before/after, transcripts)
- Update backlog + notes with outcome

---

## Task 1 evidence folder
`week7/task1-evidence/`
- Audit plan + checks
- Backlog snapshot
- Fix before/after summary
- Evidence assets (no PII)
Be consistent with naming; reuse later.

---

## Deliverables today
- Audit docs with evidence links
- Backlog updated with severity/inclusion
- Inclusive fix merged & verified
- Task 1 evidence bundle populated

---

## Next steps
- Week 8: scale prototype, ensure parity
- Keep evidence organised for pilots + assessments
